## Requirements
- Python == 2.7
- Keras == 1.0.1
- Theano == 0.9

## Prepare the data
    cd dataset; python build_data.py
    
## Test with pretrained model
    cd test
    python test.py --step=1
The model for n-step prediction is specified with --step. Models for 1-step, 3-step and 5-step prediction are provided.

To visualize the predicted results:

    python test --step=1 --visualization=true
    
## Training
    cd train
    python train.py --step=3 --hidden_dim=50 --freq_dim=10 --niter=4000 --learning_rate=0.01
    
## Note
The codes are expired for Keras >= 2.0.0. Please use the Keras == 1.0.1.
